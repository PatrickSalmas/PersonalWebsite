Notes about site:
- at a width of 632 pixels, the nav bar runs into issue
-- May want to consider a responsive layout/mobile version

- There is a small "deadzone" in the nav dropdowns that causes the dropdown to begin 
  hiding briefly
-- Need to eliminate zone so the dropdown is fluid
-- Issue doesn't seem to always occur. May need to do lot's of testing width various widths

- May want to increase the padding of the dropdowns so that if the user has some grace 
  when moving their mouse around the dropdown
-- If the user slitely moves their mouse off of the dropdown, you don't want the dropdown
   to begin hiding immediately 
   
- Add smooth scrolling transitions on projects and experience views instead of the default
  immediate jumps
  
- Add transitions to the <hr> in projects view (if we decide to keep the hr's)

- A no JS "version" of the site
-- Would have to replace the instances of 'style="display:none;"', and instead have those added
   at the begining via JS, if the user has JS enabled
-- .......

- Change the pointer events for About and resume (finger pointer thing)

- Fix the projects dropdown
-- When a project link is clicked (from the dropdown or from the main button),
   the dropdown shifts right before collapsing 
   
- TODO:
-- need to be able to go from experience view back to home via "home" link


  
- REFACTORS:
-- use transition css variables in all instances possible
-- maybe find a way to create a function for all the instances of "setTimeout" in the js code
-- make functions whereever possible, helps with readability 
-- combine CSS rules where possible (be careful here, may want to have Github source control setup before)
-- rename functions and variables
